# 👋 Hi, I'm Mihul Singh Solanki

🚀 **Senior Java Microservices Developer** | ☕ Spring Boot Enthusiast | 🤖 Chatbot Builder  
📍 Bangalore, Karnataka, India  

I’m a backend engineer with **5+ years of experience** building scalable, reliable, and sometimes *surprisingly smart* systems. I enjoy turning complex business problems into clean microservices—and occasionally teaching machines how to talk back.
